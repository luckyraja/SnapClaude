# Moonstone Deck Builds

## Deck 1: Patriot Ultron (Optimized)

**Win Rate:** ~59% (second-best Moonstone variant)
**Strategy:** Use no-ability cards to trigger Patriot's +2 power buff, copy Patriot's effect with Moonstone, and flood the board with Ultron drones.

### Decklist (12 cards):

1. **Ant-Man** (1-cost) - Ongoing buff target for Moonstone
2. **Wasp** (0-cost) - No-ability card for Patriot
3. **Quinjet** (2-cost) - Cost reduction for generated cards
4. **Mister Sinister** (2-cost) - Creates no-ability clone for Patriot
5. **Mystique** (3-cost) - Copy Patriot or Moonstone's Ongoing effect
6. **Brood** (3-cost) - Creates no-ability Broodlings for Patriot
7. **Debrii** (3-cost) - Adds Rocks (no-ability) to both sides
8. **Patriot** (3-cost) - **CORE**: +2 power to all no-ability cards
9. **Moonstone** (4-cost) - **CORE**: Copies Patriot, Ant-Man Ongoing effects
10. **Iron Patriot** (4-cost) - No-ability 5-power for Patriot buff
11. **Blue Marvel** (5-cost) - +1 power to all your cards
12. **Ultron** (6-cost) - **FINISHER**: Fills locations with 1-power drones (buffed by Patriot)

### Key Combos:
- **Patriot + Moonstone**: Moonstone copies Patriot's effect, giving double +2 buff to no-ability cards
- **Patriot + Ultron**: All Ultron drones become 3-power (1 base + 2 from Patriot)
- **Moonstone + Blue Marvel**: Copies Blue Marvel's +1 to all cards
- **Mystique Turn 5/6**: Copy Patriot or Moonstone for triple stacking

### Gameplay Tips:
1. **Turn 3**: Play Patriot in the lane where you want Moonstone
2. **Turn 4**: Play Moonstone in same lane as Patriot (copies his +2 effect)
3. **Turn 5**: Blue Marvel or continue flooding board
4. **Turn 6**: Ultron to fill all locations with buffed drones
5. **Flexibility**: Moonstone can be played before or after Patriot!

## Deck 2: Victoria Hand Big Hand

11. **White Widow** (2-cost) - Adds a card to opponent's hand (triggers Collector)
12. **Devil Dinosaur** (5-cost) - **FINISHER**: Power equals cards in hand x3

### Alternative Cards (Flex Slots):
- **Moon Girl** (4-cost) - Duplicate your hand (massive Devil Dino buff)
- **Agent Coulson** (3-cost) - Adds random cards to hand
- **Domino** (2-cost) - Always drawn on turn 2
- **Armor** (3-cost) - Protection from destruction

### Key Combos:
- **Victoria Hand + Moonstone**: All generated cards get +4 power (+2 from Victoria, +2 from Moonstone copying Victoria)
- **Quinjet + Victoria Hand**: Generated cards cost -1 and have +2 power
- **The Collector + Generation**: Every card generated buffs Collector
- **Devil Dinosaur Finish**: With 9-10 cards in hand = 27-30 power!

### Gameplay Tips:
1. **Turn 2**: Quinjet to enable cheap cards later
2. **Turn 3**: Victoria Hand in the lane you want Moonstone
3. **Turn 4**: Moonstone (now all generated cards have +4 power!)
4. **Early Game**: Play Agent 13, Cable, White Widow to generate cards
5. **Turn 5**: Devil Dinosaur for massive power based on hand size
6. **Card Management**: Keep hand full for Devil Dino, play generated cards strategically

### Power Calculation Example:
- Generated card with Victoria Hand: Base + 2 power
- With Moonstone copying Victoria: Base + 4 power
- With Quinjet: Costs 1 less
- 7 cards in hand = 21-power Devil Dinosaur

## Missing Cards Analysis:

**You DO NOT have:**
- Moonstone itself (the whole point of the 6K evaluation!)

**Good News:**
- You have ALL the key support cards for both decks
- Patriot Ultron deck is 100% ready once you get Moonstone
- Victoria Hand deck is complete (recently nerfed but still viable)

---

## Recommendation:

Based on your collection and the 5/10 rating from the evaluation:

### If You Buy Moonstone:
1. **Start with Patriot Ultron** - Highest win rate (59%), most reliable
2. **Test Victoria Hand** - Fun combo deck, good for variety
3. **Future-Proof** - Value increases as more Ongoing cards release

### If You Don't Buy:
- Both decks work without Moonstone but lose a key power multiplier
- Patriot deck still functions with just Patriot + Blue Marvel
- Victoria Hand deck still works but less explosive

**Final Score: 5/10** - Skip/Wait unless you're a dedicated Patriot player or want long-term Ongoing investment.
