# Silver Surfer Deck with Maverick

## Deck Strategy
This is a Silver Surfer deck that focuses on playing powerful 3-cost cards and then boosting them all with Silver Surfer on turn 5 or 6. The deck maximizes value from 3-cost cards while maintaining flexibility and control.

## Deck List (12 cards)

### Core Cards
1. **Silver Surfer** (3-cost) - The key card: On Reveal: Give your other 3-cost cards +2 Power
2. **Maverick** (3-cost) - New acquisition, solid stats for Surfer deck

### Best 3-Cost Cards
3. **Brood** (3-cost) - Creates 3 Broodlings, excellent for spreading power
4. **Sebastian Shaw** (3-cost) - Gains power throughout the game, excellent scaling
5. **Polaris** (3-cost) - Move opponent's cards, good for disruption
6. **Gladiator** (3-cost) - Destroys opponent's card if yours has more power, great removal
7. **Spider-Man** (3-cost) - Disrupts opponent by moving their cards
8. **Absorbing Man** (3-cost) - Can repeat Silver Surfer's buff ability (KEY CARD!)
9. **Sage** (3-cost) - Scales with cards at location, great for board filling

### Support Cards (Non-3-Cost)
10. **Sera** (5-cost) - Reduces cost of cards in hand, helps play multiple 3-costs
11. **Mockingbird** (5-cost) - Cost reduction based on cards played, good curve
12. **Shang-Chi** (4-cost) - Destroys big threats, essential tech card

## How to Play

### Early Game (Turns 1-3)
- Play your 3-cost cards like Brood, Sebastian Shaw, or Sage
- Brood is excellent early for board presence
- Sebastian Shaw grows stronger the earlier you play him

### Mid Game (Turns 4-5)
- Continue playing 3-cost cards
- If you drew Sera (5-cost), play her on turn 5 to enable multiple 3-costs on turn 6
- Consider Shang-Chi if opponent has big threats

### Late Game (Turn 6)
- **Ideal Turn 6:** Play Silver Surfer + Absorbing Man (repeats the buff) for massive power swing
- This gives you a double Surfer buff (+4 Power to all 3-costs!)
- With Sera: Can potentially play Surfer + Absorbing Man + another 3-cost
- Alternative: Just Silver Surfer + multiple 3-costs if you have Sera discount

## Key Combos
- **Silver Surfer → Absorbing Man**: THE KEY COMBO! Repeats the buff, giving all 3-costs +4 Power total
- **Sera → Multiple 3-costs on Turn 6**: Play multiple 3-costs that all get buffed
- **Brood + Silver Surfer**: The Broodlings (3-cost) also get buffed by Surfer
- **Sebastian Shaw**: Gets stronger every turn, massive with Surfer buff
- **Gladiator**: Use after Surfer buff to destroy opponent's big threats with higher power

## Win Conditions
1. Flood the board with 3-cost cards
2. Buff them all with Silver Surfer (potentially twice with Absorbing Man!)
3. Win through overwhelming power across multiple locations
4. Use Shang-Chi and Gladiator to remove opponent's big threats
5. Polaris and Spider-Man provide disruption

## Strengths
- Explosive Turn 6 power with Silver Surfer + Absorbing Man combo
- Flexible gameplay with many 3-cost options
- Brood provides excellent board presence
- Sebastian Shaw scales throughout the game
- Shang-Chi and Gladiator handle big threats
- Good disruption with Polaris and Spider-Man

## Weaknesses
- Vulnerable to Cosmo (blocks On Reveals, including Surfer and Absorbing Man)
- Can struggle against destroy decks
- Relies heavily on drawing Silver Surfer
- Shadow King can reset Sebastian Shaw's gained power

## Tech Options (Cards you could swap)
From your collection, other 3-cost options to consider:
- **Rockslide** (3-cost) - Disrupts opponent's draws
- **Storm** (3-cost) - Locks down a location early
- **Killmonger** (3-cost) - Tech against 1-cost spam decks
- **Cosmo** (3-cost) - Prevents opponent's On Reveals (but also blocks your Surfer!)
- **Mystique** (3-cost) - Only works with Ongoing abilities, NOT with Surfer
