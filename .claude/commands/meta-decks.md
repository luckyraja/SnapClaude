description: Search for the best decks in the current Marvel Snap meta
---

Search the web for the current top-tier Marvel Snap meta decks for December 2025.

Your search should find:
1. The top 5-10 meta decks currently dominating ranked play
2. Brief description of each deck's strategy
3. Key cards in each deck
4. Win rates or tier rankings if available

After gathering the meta deck information:
1. Present the decks in a clear, organized format
2. For each deck, check which cards from the deck are in the user's collection file (marvel_snap_collection_2025-12-29.csv)
3. Highlight which decks the user can build immediately (has all cards)
4. For decks the user can't build, show what key cards are missing

Focus on finding recent, authoritative sources like:
- Snap.fan
- MarvelSnapZone
- Untapped.gg
- Recent tier lists and meta reports

Format the results to be easy to read on mobile.
